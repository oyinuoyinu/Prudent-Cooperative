Deploy on Render
Create a Render account at https://render.com
Connect your GitHub repository
Click "New +" and select "Web Service"
Choose your repository

Fill in the following settings:
Name: prudentcorp (or your preferred name)
Environment: Python
Build Command: ./build.sh
Start Command: gunicorn PrudentCorp.wsgi:application

Add Environment Variables:
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY: Generate a secure key
MONO_PUBLIC_KEY: Your Mono public key
MONO_SECRET_KEY: Your Mono secret key
Any other environment-specific variables

Post-Deployment
After deployment, go to your app's URL (will be something like your-app-name.onrender.com)
Monitor the deployment logs for any issues
Test the Mono bank integration functionality
Verify the membership system works as expected

Important Notes:

The deployment preserves your existing membership and payment systems as specified in the memories
Mono bank integration remains separate and functional
All sensitive keys (Mono API keys) are stored as environment variables
The database will be automatically provisioned by Render
Would you like me to provide more details about any of these steps or help with a specific part of the deployment process?
