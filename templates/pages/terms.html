                            Welcome to our website, a platform for connecting pet owners with veterinary members for virtual appointments. By using this website, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. Please take the time to read them carefully.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Service Availability</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">
                            Our platform provides a virtual consultation service that allows pet owners to connect with veterinary members for video or chat appointments. The availability of this service depends on the availability of veterinary members and may be subject to change without notice. We do our best to ensure that a veterinary member is always available to attend to clients, but we cannot guarantee this.
                        </p>

                        <h3>User Responsibility</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">
                            Pet owners and veterinary members using this platform are responsible for ensuring that all information provided is accurate and up-to-date. You must keep your account information, including your contact details, up-to-date at all times. You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and password and for preventing unauthorized access to your account.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Virtual Consultations</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">
                            Virtual consultations are intended to provide pet owners with advice and support for minor health issues. In the event that a pet requires more serious treatment, the veterinary member may advise a visit to a physical clinic. We do not provide emergency veterinary services through this platform, and pet owners should always seek immediate veterinary attention in the event of an emergency.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Fees and Payment</h3>

Payments for services provided through the Platform will be processed through a secure payment system.
